SmallRye welcomes you to our new community for developing shared
implementations of Eclipse MicroProfile specifications!

Right now we're still in the process of seeding the initial versions of
the repositories for each Eclipse MicroProfile specification implementation.
As they're released we will be updating the overview page and creating
a page specific to each implementation on the website.

Currently we have released the following implementations:

*Config*, *REST Client*, *Open API*

The plan is to have the remainder migrated and released within the next couple of weeks.
