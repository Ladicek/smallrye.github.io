{uri-smallrye}[SmallRye] implements {uri-microprofile}[Eclipse MicroProfile] specifications for use within any runtime.
Currently, SmallRye is included in https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus],
https://thorntail.io[Thorntail], https://wildfly.org[WildFly],
and the reactive implementations are part of https://openliberty.io/[Open Liberty].

That's great, but that's only implementing what's been defined by a specification.
Does {uri-smallrye}[SmallRye] only implement the specifications "_as is_"?
How do new ideas get added to {uri-microprofile}[MicroProfile],
either as new specifications or changes to an existing specification?

Questions like these,
and others like them,
are what I hear often from those not familiar with exactly how {uri-microprofile}[MicroProfile] operates.
Unlike how the JCP operated in the past when defining Java EE specifications,
{uri-microprofile}[MicroProfile] takes a very different approach.
In {uri-microprofile}[MicroProfile] we define specifications based on existing implementations and usage within projects,
as it offers a greater indication that what's being proposed is useful to developers.
It's much harder to create an API from ideas and have it be useful
than to define a specification based on an already working implementation.

How does this relate to how {uri-smallrye}[SmallRye] develops implementations?
Since its creation {uri-smallrye}[SmallRye] was purposefully focused on implementing the {uri-microprofile}[MicroProfile] specifications,
while seeking to improve the specifications and TCKs when issues were found.
Having reached a point where the implementations are stable and easily kept in line with modifications to existing specifications,
it frees those working on the project to shift our focus to innovation!

What type of innovation are we talking about?
In theory, it could be absolutely anything.
In practice, we're not proposing a complete free for all, as that leads to churn without results.
We have a few initiatives that are underway where we are beginning to innovate with {uri-microprofile}[MicroProfile].
We've begun work on an entirely new implementation for Fault Tolerance, see https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/issues/102[here],
which aims to be reactive friendly while still enabling the same functionality for imperative programming.
In https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config[SmallRye Config] we will be investigating how to implement support for
using a pre captured configuration during the creation of later ``ConfigSource``s and ``ConfigSourceProvider``s,
allowing configuration to be used to create latter stage configuration instances.
There are also other innovations underway within the reactive sphere of {uri-smallrye}[SmallRye] that we intend to announce soon.

In addition to innovation within {uri-smallrye}[SmallRye] projects,
we're in the process of accepting the donation from the https://github.com/microprofile-extensions[MicroProfile Extensions] project.
The https://github.com/microprofile-extensions[MicroProfile Extensions] project includes many new `ConfigSource` and `Converter` types
that will be added to {uri-smallrye}[SmallRye]. A big thanks to Phillip and Derek for agreeing to this and pushing it forward.

All this innovation in {uri-smallrye}[SmallRye] is great,
but what does that mean for {uri-microprofile}[MicroProfile] specifications?
Do they have these new innovations as well?
In the short term, no they wouldn't.
The medium to longer-term goal for any innovation created in {uri-smallrye}[SmallRye] is for it to be proposed to existing
or new {uri-microprofile}[MicroProfile] specifications.
